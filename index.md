I am a Royal Society University Research Fellow at the [Higgs Centre for Theoretical Physics, University of Edinburgh](https://higgs.ph.ed.ac.uk/). I obtained my BA and MA from Cambridge University, U.K., and PhD from Stony Brook University, USA, under the advice of Prof. George Sterman. I previously held research positions at UC Los Angeles (2015-2018), ETH Zürich (2018-2020), and Oxford University (2020-2011).
<!-- the [Mani L. Bhanumik Institute for Theoretical Physics at UC Los Angeles](https://bhaumik-institute.physics.ucla.edu/), the [Institute for Theoretical Physics at ETH Zürich](https://itp.phys.ethz.ch/), and the [Rudolf Peierls Centre for Theoretical Physics at Oxford University](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/subdepartment/rudolf-peierls-centre-theoretical-physics). -->

My research focuses on precision calculations in quantum field theory, bringing together modern methods for scattering amplitudes, state-of-the-art loop integration techniques, and effective field theories.

Recent research highlights include precise computations for LHC processes with a large number of final-state particles, and applications of quantum field theory methods to binary black hole dynamics probed by gravitational wave detectors.
