I am a Royal Society University Research Fellow at the [Higgs Centre for Theoretical Physics, University of Edinburgh](https://higgs.ph.ed.ac.uk/). I obtained my BA and MA from Cambridge University, U.K., and PhD from Stony Brook University, USA, under the advice of Prof. George Sterman. I previously held research positions at UC Los Angeles (2015-2018), ETH ZÃ¼rich (2018-2020), and Oxford University (2020-2011).

My research focuses on precision calculations in quantum field theory, bringing together modern methods for scattering amplitudes, state-of-the-art loop integration techniques, and effective field theories.

Recent research highlights include precise computations for LHC processes with a large number of final-state particles, and applications of quantum field theory methods to binary black hole dynamics probed by gravitational wave detectors.
