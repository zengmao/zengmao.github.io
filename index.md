I am a Royal Society University Research Fellow at the [Higgs Centre for Theoretical Physics, University of Edinburgh](https://higgs.ph.ed.ac.uk/). I obtained my BA and MA from Cambridge University, U.K., and PhD from Stony Brook University, USA, under the advice of Prof. George Sterman. I previously held research positions at UC Los Angeles (2015-2018), ETH ZÃ¼rich (2018-2020), and Oxford University (2021).

My research uses quantum field theory to make precise predictions for fundamental physics experiments. In the last few years, my collaborators and I developed a formalism for computing classical general relativity obesrvables, relevant for LIGO / VIRGO observations, by taking classical limits of scattering amplitudes in quantum field theory. I am also involved in precise calculations relevant for the Large Hadron Collider, in perturbative QCD and sometimes in simplifying supersymmetric theories.

My research brings together a wide array of theoretical developments in high energy physics, including modern methods for scattering amplitudes, state-of-the-art loop integration techniques, and effective field theories.

### Seminars and Conferences

I'm co-organizing the weekly [Higgs Centre Amplitudes Meetings](/amps/).

I'm co-organizing the [Higgs Centre Workshop on Gravitational Self-Force and Scattering Amplitudes](https://higgs.ph.ed.ac.uk/workshops/gravitational-self-force-and-scattering-amplitudes/) to be held in March 2024.

I'm co-organizing the 2024 MIAPbP workshop, [EFT and Multi-loop Methods for Advancing Precision in Collider and Gravitational Wave Physics](https://www.munich-iapbp.de/eft-multi-loop-methods) to be held in October 2024.
